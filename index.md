Our research focuses on applying computational and theoretical methods to understand and quantitatively predict fundamental biological processes such as protein-ligand binding, solvation, and solubility. We seek to provide an atomically detailed understanding of these processes at a level of accuracy that can be useful in industrial applications.

We are also involved in a variety of collaborative and community efforts including:
- The [Open Force Field Initiative](https://openforcefield.org)
- The [SAMPL Challenges](https://www.samplchallenges.org)
- The Open Free Energy project
