I"•<p>Our research focuses on applying computational and theoretical methods to understand and quantitatively predict fundamental biological processes such as protein-ligand binding, solvation, and solubility. We seek to provide an atomically detailed understanding of these processes at a level of accuracy that can be useful in industrial applications.</p>

<p>We are also involved in a variety of collaborative and community efforts including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://openforcefield.org">Open Force Field Initiative</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.samplchallenges.org">SAMPL Challenges</a></li>
  <li>The Open Free Energy project</li>
</ul>
