<h3 id="david-mobley-principal-investigator--"><strong>David Mobley (Principal Investigator)</strong> -</h3>

<p>David Mobley did his undergraduate work in Physics at the University of California, Davis, graduating in 2000. After that he finished a M.S. (2002) and a Ph.D. (2004) in Physics at UCD, doing graduate research in condensed matter theory and biophysics with Daniel L. Cox and Rajiv Singh. Following his Ph.D. he took a position with Ken Dill at the University of California, San Francisco, doing molecular simulations relating to protein-ligand binding and hydration thermodynamics. This work ultimately moved with him to the University of New Orleans. However, after his postdoc ended in 2008, he did a brief stint as Chief Science Officer of a startup company (Simprota Corporation) doing contract work designing peptide diagnostics. He then left to join UNO in Fall 2008. Then, in 2012, after almost 4 years at UNO, he moved to his current position in Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. In January 2013 he also received a joint appointment in the Department of Chemistry at UCI. He was promoted to Associate Professor at UCI, and received tenure, in July 2014, then was promoted to Professor in 2018. He served on the advisory board for Schrodinger software from 2013-2016. He currently serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design and the Journal of Molecular Recognition, on the scientific advisory board for OpenEye Scientific Software, as a founding and managing editor for the Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science, and as an Open Science Fellow for Silicon Therapeutics. He also maintains a personal blog where he writes about his Christian faith and other issues.</p>

<h3 id="jessica-maat-graduate-student--"><strong>Jessica Maat (Graduate Student)</strong> -</h3>

<p>Jessica joined the Mobley group in 2018. She graduated University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2017 with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Chemistry. She worked with Prof. Christine Isborn from UC Merced on her undergraduate honors thesis on calculating the hyperpolarizaibility of organic electrooptic chromophores and modeling their excited state coupling. Jessica currently works on improving accuracy of force fields in the Open Force Field Initiative. Specifically her project focuses on developing using data driven methods to improve energetics and geometries of trivalent nitrogens, a very prevalent chemical feature in small drug molecules.</p>

<h3 id="danielle-bergazin-graduate-student--"><strong>Danielle Bergazin (Graduate Student)</strong> -</h3>

<p>Danielle joined the Mobley lab in 2018 under the Pharmacological Sciences Ph.D. program. Her previous work involved contributing to the development and application of BLUES, and is currently involved in the SAMPL series of blind challenges. Her long-term research interest is to produce computational methods that reduce the cost of drug discovery, as well as expand the applications of computational chemistry in drug discovery.</p>

<h3 id="hannah-baumann-graduate-student--"><strong>Hannah Baumann (Graduate Student)</strong> -</h3>

<p>Hannah graduated from Johannes-Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany, with a pharmacy degree in 2018. During her time in pharmacy school she worked with Prof. González at the University Jaume in Castelló de la Plana, Spain, synthesizing a new cysteine protease inhibitor against Trypanosoma. She also did an internship for six months at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, where she applied relative binding free energy calculations in ongoing drug discovery projects. Motivated by this experience, Hannah decided to come to UC Irvine, where she joined the Mobley lab in Fall 2018. Her research focuses on the calculation of binding free energies using a non-equilibrium alchemical approach. Hannah’s main interest is to develop and improve computational methods that help discover new drugs.</p>

<h3 id="oanh-tran-graduate-student--"><strong>Oanh Tran (Graduate Student)</strong> -</h3>

<p>Oanh Tran completed her B.S. and B.S.A. at the University of Texas at Austin in biochemistry and chemistry. As an undergraduate student, Tran worked on multiple research projects from her institution as well as from other internships across the U.S. She is currently pursuing a Ph.D. and working in both the Mobley lab and the Poulos lab. She also has the best corgi in the world, named Brisket.</p>

<h3 id="ana-caldaruse-graduate-student--"><strong>Ana Caldaruse (Graduate Student)</strong> -</h3>

<p><a href="acaldaru@uci.edu">UCI email</a> - <a href="https://github.com/AnaCaldaruse">GitHub</a> - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-maria-caldaruse-a6253183/">LinkedIn</a> - <a href="https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0002-8239-5637">ORCID</a></p>

<p>Ana graduated with her B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from UC Santa Cruz in 2015. She did research in undergrad but didn’t feel ready for a PhD after graduation so she sought out research positions before applying to graduate school. She worked for a clinical trials company and in research at Cedars Sinai Medical Center where she studied the molecular mechanisms of heart failure and development of a blood based bioassay to determine disease progression. In 2020, Ana made the transition into the Pharmacological Sciences PhD program at UC Irvine and joined the Mobley lab. Her work focuses on implementing separated topologies approach into the Lead Optimization Mapper (LOMap) to plan out binding free energy calculations that can be used in the pharmaceutical industry. Besides research she likes to be involved in mentoring students to help ease their transition into graduate school. Other things that bring Ana joy are reading – particularly dystopian novels, trying new coffee shops, and experiencing new cultures through travel and cuisine.</p>
