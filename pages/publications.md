## Publication list: 

A list of Mobley lab publications can be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k4Q4JN8AAAAJ&hl=en). To reduce administrative burden, we don't maintain a separate publication list.

### Data sets
- We compiled an extensive experimental dataset of hydration free energies which is relatively popular ([DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ct800409d)). The Supporting Info connected with the paper has the dataset, but we also have [the mol2 files with partial charges](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lg9HQHL47H1h0RvkgTR65ci_6di8cFw1/view?usp=sharing) and [the parameter and coordinate files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LirT902p3XzFf4F6TdAgwSTyf2Jk7-Pl/view?usp=sharing). Of course, [our FreeSolv database has a more up-to-date dataset](https://github.com/MobleyLab/FreeSolv).
On the same dataset, we also did a large number of hydration free energy calculations in implicit solvent ([DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp0764384)) using molecular simulations. The [test set is available](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lj1JUSVlOLeXIBaw68A2rm6GKOvnL9mV/view?usp=sharing), as is the set of [stored AMBER trajectories](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LnvvKPt0I8GLAB6x7egOwHfXXrMc879a/view?usp=sharing) for the molecules.

### Supporting files from publications
- S. Liu and D. L. Mobley, “Is ring breaking feasible in relative binding free energy calculations?”, in J. Chem. Inf. Model. 55(4):727-735 (2015). [Supporting trajectory files](http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/27d9s5j9)

### Videos
- G. J. Rocklin, D. L. Mobley, K. A. Dill, and P. H. Hünenberger, “Calculating the binding free energies of charged species based on explicit-solvent simulations employing lattice-sum methods: An accurate correction scheme for finite-size effects”, in J. Chem. Phys. 139(18):184103 (2013). (DOI).  ([A talk on the charge correction topic is available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeO2vexSSXM); it was given to the Gilson and Shen groups by Gabe Rocklin).
